 * upto, but not including "to".  "data" must contain the memory address
 * of one byte of readable data.
 * Example:  if data points to a memory address storing the value:
 *           212 (base 10) = 11010100 (base 2)
 * Then the bits would be numbered as follows:
 *           [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
 *            1  1  0  1  0  1  0  0
 * If from=1 and to=6, then bits [1] to [5] would be retreived
 *              [1][2][3][4][5]
 *               1  0  1  0  1
 * and the value returned by this function would be:
 *           10101 (base 2) = 21
